              Like many of you, I wasn't born with an innate sense of calm. In fact, my journey began in quite the opposite place - a world of constant anxiety, overthinking, and the relentless pursuit of external validation. I was a successful marketing executive in Mumbai, but behind the polished exterior was someone struggling to find genuine peace and purpose.

              The turning point came during a particularly stressful period in 2017. I was working 14-hour days, my relationships were suffering, and I felt disconnected from everything that truly mattered. It was during a brief visit to a meditation retreat in Rishikesh that I experienced, for the first time in years, a moment of genuine stillness.
            </motion.p>

            <motion.p
              initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}

              viewport={{ once: true }}
            >
              That moment changed everything. I realized that the peace I was seeking wasn't something to be achieved or acquired - it was already within me, waiting to be uncovered. I began a dedicated practice of mindfulness, studied with various teachers, and slowly started sharing my insights with friends and family.

              What started as personal transformation soon became a calling. People began reaching out, sharing their own struggles, and asking for guidance. I realized that in our hyper-connected, fast-paced world, many of us are yearning for the same thing - a return to simplicity, authenticity, and inner calm.

              Today, through my podcast, coaching work, and community, I have the privilege of walking alongside thousands of people on their own journeys to inner peace. My approach isn't about perfection or spiritual bypassing - it's about honest, practical wisdom that acknowledges our struggles while gently guiding us toward greater clarity and calm.
