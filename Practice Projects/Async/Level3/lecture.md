1. Simulate a Food Delivery
Task. 
Create a function orderFood that returns a Promise. IT should resolve after 2 second with "🍕Pizza delivered!"
Bonus : Add a chance to reject with "🚫 Delivery failed!".

2. Chained Promises: User -> Posts -> Comments
Task.
 Create getUser() -> resolves with {id: 1, name: "Username"}
 getPosts(userId) -> resolves with list of post titles.
